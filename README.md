# About this Project
I created this project to learn how to use Google Firebase to host React Apps without a backend. I also implemented my own techniques to handle swipe imput from users (I am not sure if my solution is a best practice or not).
The goal of this project is to create an app that my wife and I can use to manage our chores and shopping lists so that we do not run out of beer in the fridge! Or have mold in the shower...

## Deploy
1. firebase logout
2. firebase login
3. firebase deploy --only hosting
